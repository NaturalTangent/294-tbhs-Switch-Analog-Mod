Ben mods a Nintendo Switch!

Max has been playing his Nintendo Switch 24/7 since he got it, causing him to deal with a debilitating thumb cramp from the analog stick. Ben offers to 3D print an add-on for the joy con to move the analog stick to the proper position. Ben attempts to save Max from making a tragic mistake. Visit Ben Heck page at: http://bit.ly/2rDvEFt
